# WEEK ONE: The first pull request

It's sunday. This week I worked on a real IT project for the first time in
my life. First but not last that is for sure !

During the week I got introduced to a concept called the pull request and 
that is what I am going to talk about in this post. But first let me 
properly introduce the project I am working on.

I am working on a project called **January** which stands for Java
Numeral Arrays (?), basicly it's numPy for Java. There are two companys
supporting the project: Diamond Light Source, and Kichwa Coders. I am 
working with Kichwa Coders.

Sooo what is a **pull request**?? To answer this question we have to
look at how an open source project works on **GitHub**. On GitHub when
you create a public project people like you and me can fork it, meaning
they are creating there own version of this very project. On this new
version of the project they can change things, and if they want to have
these changes implemented in the main project they have to do a **pull
request**. The owner can then either implement the feature or the fix, or
reject the request.

This concept is **very** important and will probably folow me during my
whole internship.
