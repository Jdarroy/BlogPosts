# WEEK FIVE: What Is Working In Open Source Like ?

> Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made
available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to
study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.  \-

I am Yannick Mayeur a french computer science student doing a work experience
in the UK. And this is my feeling about working with open source.

## Why open source ?

Let me tell you a story. A company asks someone in their software team to build
a software to do a certain task. It takes him a lot of time but he manages to
do it, he is the only one working on the project so there is not one comment in
the code nor a documentation to help maintain the code. He later leaves the
company, the software slowly becomes useless as no one left knows how to use
it.

If this company had created an open source project instead this problem
wouldn't have occured.

Help spread open-source or ensure a job for life by using this
[guide](https://www.se.rit.edu/~tabeec/RIT_441/Resources_files/How%20To%20Write%20Unmaintainable%20Code.pdf)
on how to write unmaintainable code. But seriously don't.

## Get started

Getting started with working open source is fairly easy, because a lot of
people write guides or [blog
posts](https://github.com/yannick-mayeur/blogposts) to help people get started
with the tricky stuff like git. All you need is a computer and motivation!


## My feeling on the subject

It is now the end of my fith week working at Kichwa Coders Ldt. I worked on two
different projects of the Eclipse Foundation:
* Eclipse January wich is a set of libraries to help process
a lot of data. It is mainly used by [Diamond Light
Source](http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home.html) scientists to process the data they
get from their particle accelerator.
* Eclipse CDT which is an IDE for C and C++, wich is used by a lot of people.

Knowing I contributed to these two big projects, a lot of people use every day
makes me kinda proud. And the truth is it wasn't even that hard, with my not
that big knowledge of how to work on big projects I have done some changes that
will have a lot of visibility like [bug
515296](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=515296). That is because
if you have a problem a whole community that works on the project and that
maybe already had the problem can help you.

## Conclusion

Knowing that other people know exactly what code you wrote puts pressure on
you, and helps in my opinion to give the best of yourself. But this community
can also help you out when you are stuck with a problem. All this and more make
being part of an open source project a very pleasant experience.
